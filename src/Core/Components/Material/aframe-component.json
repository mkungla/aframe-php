	"description":"The material component defines the appearance of an entity. The built-in shaders allow us to define properties such as color, opacity, or textures. Custom shaders can be registered to extend the material component to allow for a wide range of visual effects. The geometry component can be defined alongside to provide a shape alongside the appearance to create a complete mesh. The material component is coupled to shaders. Some of the built-in shading models will provide properties like color or texture to the material component.",
